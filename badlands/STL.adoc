== STL
Adoption is very divided...

.Speculative and Unfounded Personal Theory
- Western World: Lower adoption
 * more focus on getting things done; entrepreneurial
- Eastern World: Higher adoption
 * academic/mathematical background

.Reasons for low adoption
- iostreams are the devil's work!
- associated/perceived bloat and slow compilation
  * still true: https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/sg14/bp-DDWbFhIQ/xeTL0076BgAJ
- slow or cumbersome debugging
- not everyone is willing to follow STL coding style and naming
- gamedev specific allocation needs
  * limited allocator model pre C++17

== STL (continued)
It's not always a binary choice

- the STL atomics and locks are generally used as is
- the `Iterator` concept is copied and re-implemented
  * if nothing else just to enable `ranged-for`'s
- sparing use of algorithms
  * Unreal Engine mirrors them for their containers

== STL - case study: std::string
Every studio/engine reinvents the string wheel

- specific localization needs
  * very tight coupling with game data
- previous STL implementations made awkward choices
  * for ex: copy on write on older GCC
  * no control over Small Buffer Optimisation
- no need for streams
  * C printf style preferred
  * I/O handled in bulk elsewhere

== [EA]STL
*EASTL from Electronic Arts* -  video game specific implementation of STL

Originally started 10 years ago for internal use, now open source: +
https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL

Normally follows the `std::` nomenclature and style

== [EA]STL - Differences / Changes
- written in a more straightforward/direct way (less general)
  * easier to debug, faster release builds
- simplified allocator model - games specific
  * alignment aware, naming support, etc
- intrusive containers
- fixed containers
  * no allocation, only within provided block
- new containers
  * `ring_buffer`, `heap`, `priority_queue`, etc
- smart pointers, type traits
  * now obsolete

== STLport
Quick shoutout to http://stlport.sourceforge.net/Home.shtml

Multiplatform implementation with some extensions. Abandoned since 2010

- more advanced debug mode
- hash tables, singly-linked list, rope
- better `std::allocator`
- used in embedded / limited environments
  * still available today in Android NDK

== WG21/SG14
Game dev is officially recognized and represented in the ISO C++ Standard committee

== WG21/SG14 (continued)
Video games and embedded programming study sub-group +
Tries to propose new, optimized containers, data structures and even language changes

Proposals and discussion +
https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/group/sg14/

- fixed point numeric library
- view-only alternative to `std::function`
  * function_ref
- highly specialized multithreaded utilities
  * RCU and hazard pointers
- `likely` / `unlikely` optimization hints
  * got voted in for C++20
- alternatives to error handling
  * `status_code` and `error_code`
- bike shedding :)
