The Badlands of C++: Professional Game Development

A lighthearted yet technical talk about the way C++ is used (and misused) in video games programming.

A survey detailing how game developers approach everything C++: from compilation to usage of STL, or extending the language with reflection systems. A showcase of some good things, some bad, while portraing the challenging demands of games programming.

The target audience is everyone interested or aspiring in professional game development, although veterans should also find something interesting.
