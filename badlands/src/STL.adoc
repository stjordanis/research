== STL Adoption
Adoption is very divided...

(Speculative and Unfounded Personal Theory)

*Western World* +
_Lower adoption_ +
more focus on getting things done +
entrepreneurial

*Eastern World* +
_Higher adoption_ +
academic/mathematical background

[%notitle, background-iframe="src/header.html"]
== STL Adoption (continued)
Reasons for low adoption...

[%step]
- `iostreams` are the devil's work!
- associated/perceived bloat and slow compilation
  * still true: https://goo.gl/Tzqwye
- slow or cumbersome debugging
- not everyone is willing to follow STL coding style and naming
- gamedev specific allocation needs
  * limited allocator model pre C++17

[%notitle, background-iframe="src/header.html"]
== STL (continued)
It's not always a binary choice...

[.step]
- the STL atomics and locks are generally used as is
- the `Iterator` concept is copied and re-implemented
  * if nothing else just to enable `ranged-for`'s
- sparing use of algorithms
  * Unreal Engine mirrors them for their containers

[%notitle, background-iframe="src/header.html"]
== STL std::string
Case study: `std::string`...

[.step]
- specific localization needs
  * very tight coupling with game data
- previous STL implementations made awkward choices
  * for ex: copy on write on older GCC
  * no control over _Small Buffer Optimisation_
- no need for streams
  * C `printf` style preferred
  * I/O handled in bulk elsewhere

== [EA]STL
_EASTL from Electronic Arts_ -  video game specific implementation of STL

Originally started 10 years ago for internal use, now open source: +
https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL

Normally follows the `std::` nomenclature and style

[%notitle, background-iframe="src/header.html"]
== [EA]STL Diff.One
Differences / Changes...

[.step]
- written in a more straightforward/direct way (less general)
  * easier to debug, faster release builds
- simplified allocator model - games specific
  * alignment aware, naming support, etc
- intrusive containers

[%notitle, background-iframe="src/header.html"]
== [EA]STL Diff.Two
Differences / Changes (continued)

[.step]
- fixed containers
  * no allocation, only within provided block
- new containers
  * `ring_buffer`, `heap`, `priority_queue`, etc
- smart pointers, type traits
  * now obsolete

[background-iframe="src/header.html"]
== STLport
Quick shoutout to +
http://stlport.sourceforge.net/Home.shtml

Multiplatform implementation with some extensions. Abandoned since 2010

[%notitle, background-iframe="src/header.html"]
== STLport (continued)
Features...

[.step]
- more advanced debug mode
- hash tables, singly-linked list, rope
- better `std::allocator`
- used in embedded / limited environments
  * still available today in Android NDK

[%notitle, background-iframe="src/header.html"]
== WG21/SG14 List.One
Current topics...

[.step]
- fixed point numeric library
- view-only alternative to `std::function`
  * function_ref
- highly specialized multithreaded utilities
  * RCU and hazard pointers

[%notitle, background-iframe="src/header.html"]
== WG21/SG14 List.Two
Current topics (continued)

  * got voted in for C++20
- alternatives to error handling
  * `status_code` and `error_code`
- bike shedding :)
