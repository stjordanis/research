== Exceptions - overview
Almost never used due to speed penalties of `throw`-ing and `catch`-ing

A small (not totally fair) demonstration...

---------------------------------------
#include <stdexcept>

int func()
{
    throw std::exception();
}

== Exceptions - alternatives
Handling of errors...

[.step]
- during dev: hard exit is requested on error
- C style last-error or status arguments
- impossible to handle errors in constructors
  * solution is to have `Create`, `Instantiate`, `Begin` replacements

== Exceptions - alternatives (continued)
Handling of errors...

[.step]
- exceptions are still used in non critical code
  * online services
  * OS/system interactions
- reputation problem feedback loop
  * past gen console platforms didn't support them
  * compiler support was lackluster
  * dev didn't use them
