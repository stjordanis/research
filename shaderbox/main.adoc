== About Me
TODO:

== Agenda (from CppCon)
- Introduction and motivation
- General design
- How swizzling is achieved
- Corner cases and limitations
- Optimization with Expression Templates [possibly]
- Quick intro to shader graphics
- Showcase and walk-through of effects
- Benchmarks and conclusions

== Agenda
- About Me
- What are shaders
 * General GPU background
 * Types of
 * Examples from Shadertoy
- Motivation
 * Commute story (with Google Maps / Train images)
 * Showcase on phone
 * Showcase on PC
- Shader languages
 * HLSL vs GLSL
 * new developments (CUDA, Metal etc)
 * Emulation (list all the libs)
- General design
 * vector maths
 * utility functions
 * glue layer
- vec<> design
 * base vs type
 * init and others
- mat<> design
- Swizzling
 * what and why
 * how it's achieved (the union trick)
- Challenges
 * the 3 main methods
- Quick intro to raymarching
 * find tutorial on Shadertoy
- Showcase
 * my stuff
 * benchmarks

== What Are Shaders

// public domain

Shaders are computer graphics programs used for a variety of specialized effects

NOTE: Originally the term was introduced by PIXAR in 1988, for their RenderMan system

== Shaders on GPU's

- computer graphics
- image manipulation
- general purpose - highly parallel - processing

== Why (generaly) on GPU

IMPORTANT: We will concentrate on image-only shaders

== Motivation
I wanted to create images like...

also because GPU driver render bugs

Let's see how C++ can help out!
