Shaders are computer graphics programs used for a variety of specialized effects

NOTE: Originally the term was introduced by PIXAR in 1988, for their RenderMan system

== Shaders on GPU's

- computer graphics
- image manipulation
- general purpose - highly parallel - processing

== Why (generaly) on GPU

IMPORTANT: We will concentrate on image-only shaders

== Motivation
I wanted to create images like...

also because GPU driver render bugs

Let's see how C++ can help out!
