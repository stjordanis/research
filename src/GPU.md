#### Desktop vs Mobile GPU's

Desktop GPU                              | Mobile GPU 
-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
Maximize throughput, minimize latency    | -
Lots of memory                           | Limited memory
Hight power consumption (100W+)          | Low power consumption (~100mW)
No restrictions on draw calls            | Limitations on draw calls
Transparency is not a problem            | Opaque geometry prefered / Expensive overdraw
On-demand as-you-send rendering          | Tiled rendering
