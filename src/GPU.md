### desktop vs mobile GPU's

- Maximize throughput, minimize latency
- Lots of memory
- Hight power consumption (100W+)
- No restrictions on draw calls
- Transparency is not a problem
- On-demand as-you-send rendering

- Limited memory
- Low power consumption (~100mW)
- Limitations on draw calls
- Opaque geometry prefered
- Expensive overdraw
- Tiled rendering
