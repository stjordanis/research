== Boost - Diss
Very frowned upon and highly discouraged...

== Boost - Reasons
Reasons...

[.step]
- (again my theory) clash of cultures:
  * Boost is "academic" and research driven
  * game dev is pragmatic and get-it-done
- historically didn't play well with MSVC
  * still doesn't: `boost::hana` (but getting very close)

[%notitle, background-iframe="src/header.html"]
== Boost - Reasons.Two
Reasons (continued)

[.step]
- by now best libraries made it into the standard
  * `thread`, `mutex`, `unique_lock`, `chrono`, `filesystem` etc
- difficulty to integrate & setup
  * `bcp` tool makes this easier
- slow compilation times
